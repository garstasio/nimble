Github issues, the way it should be

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rnicholus/nimble.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rnicholus/nimble)

#### UPDATE: Work to switch the existing Ember code to Angular is being staged in the [angular branch][angular].  See [issue #7][7] for details.


This project will (hopefully, if I stick with it & don't get sidetracked) be an attempt to provide a snappy SPA backed by Github issues.  The current UI provided by Github for their issue tracker is useful, but a bit primitive and inefficient from a UX perspective.  There are some other projects with similar goals as nimble, but they are all lacking in some areas and require dropping back to the native issues UI to perform some tasks.  I hope to make use of the entire [Github Issues API][api] to ensure that the native Issues UI is no longer needed.

Planning documents will be maintained (at least initially) in the [wiki][wiki].  Actionable items will ultimately be backed by [issues][issues], ironically.

The code for this project will be AGPL licensed.  Please see the [LICENSE file][license] for the leaglese.
